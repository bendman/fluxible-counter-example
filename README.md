# Fluxible Counter

Fluxible Counter is a minimal example of an [isomorphic/universal](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) Javascript application using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Fluxible](http://fluxible.io/). It was built first by running the [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) [generator](http://fluxible.io/quick-start.html). As a result, it started with basic [routing](http://fluxible.io/tutorials/routing.html), and development and production builds from [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

## Get Started

Run `npm run dev` or `npm run build && npm run start` for the development (hot loaded) or production (minified) builds, respectively, then navigate to your *localhost:3000*.


## Todo

- Add examples of unit testing components and actions
- Add comments to explain things in detail
- Add asyncronous actions
